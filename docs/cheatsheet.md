![image-20210130093920438](image-20210130093920438.png)

* x0 - x30: 64-bit general purpose registers, where: 
  
  *  x0-x18. callee can corrupt
     *  x0-x7  Arguments and  return values.  additional arguments are on the stack
     * x8: Indirect result. For syscalls, the syscall number is in r8
  *  x19-x29: callee must preserve
     *  x9-x28: caller-saved registers. In general okay to use in your code
  * x29 (FP): frame pointer, pointing to the base of the current stack frame
  * x30 (LR): link register
* SP      Stack pointer                      
* PC     Program counter                     

Our [GDB customization](gdb.md) color-codes the registers. 

White highlight (x0-x7): parameter/results; red background (x19-x29): callee saved. 

(Green reg values: the values have changed since the last instruction)

## Exception levels

| AArch64/ARMv8 name |                          remarks                           |
| :----------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------: |
|        EL3         |        highest exception level, mostly for firmware        |
|        EL2         | exception level for hypervisors like Xen (or parts of KVM) |
|        EL1         |            the Linux kernel is running in this             |
|        EL0         |                 for unprivileged userland                  |

### Exception vectors

EL1t Exception is taken from EL1 while stack pointer was shared with EL0. This happens when SPSel register holds the value 0.

EL1h Exception is taken from EL1 at the time when dedicated stack pointer was allocated for EL1. This means that SPSel holds the value 1 and this is the mode that we are currently using.

EL0_64 Exception is taken from EL0 executing in 64-bit mode.

EL0_32 Exception is taken from EL0 executing in 32-bit mode.

## PSTATE

See "Fundamentals of ARMv8-A", Chapter "Processor state"

## Return from exceptions

**ELR_EL1**, Exception Link Register. "When taking an exception to EL1, holds the address to return to."

**SPSR_EL1,** status regs, including irq enable/disable

**eret**. Returns from an exception. It restores the processor state based on SPSR_ELn and branches to ELR_ELn, where n is the current exception level.

## Common instructions

[A more detailed instruction quick reference](arm64.pdf) 

* mrs	Load value from a system register to one of the general purpose registers (x0â€“x30)
* and	Perform the logical AND operation. 
* cbz	Compare the result of the previously executed operation to 0 and jump (or `branch` in ARM terminology) to the provided label if the comparison yields true.
* b		Perform an unconditional branch to some label.
* adr	Load a label's relative address into the target register. In this case, we want pointers to the start and end of the `.bss` region.
* sub	Subtract values from two registers.
* bl	"Branch with a link": perform an unconditional branch and store the return address in x30 (the link register). When the subroutine is finished, use the `ret` instruction to jump back to the return address.
* mov	Move a value between registers or from a constant to a register.
* cbz, cbnz	Compare and Branch on Zero, Compare and Branch on Non-Zero.
* stp 	store a pair of registers

## Architecture naming

There is an updated ARM architecture revision called "ARMv8", which evolved from the ARMv7 architecture. Among other things it introduces a new execution state called "AArch64", which provides a full 64-bit architecture.

ARMv8 compliant implementations can provide this state or not, also they are free to implement the "AArch32" state, which closely resembles the ARMv7 architecture. So both 32-bit and 64-bit states are optional - but you should of course have at least one ;-). ARM Cortex cores provide both states, while there are implementations from other vendors which do not provide AArch32, for instance.

The Linux kernel chose to call this new architecture "arm64", the same name got picked up by Debian for their architecture port name.

The GNU toolchain however elected the official "aarch64" name for the port, so the GCC (cross-)compiler is usually called "aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc". So although the arm64 name is not official, it can be used interchangeably for aarch64.
